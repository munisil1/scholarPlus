This project is a combination of hardware(DE1 & other components) and software(Android Studio IDE). 
The Android part communicates with DE1-SoC through a Bluetooth chip to allow an instructor to input and save their data(multiple choice questions and students answers)in a FireBase database.
The database then stores the data offline for later use. The android app not only provides the students with direction to their destination through navigating a google map view,
but also allows them to answer in class questions in real-time, and their answers are compared to those stored in the database and graded instantly.
